/**
 * The Model is the most fundamental component in an MVC application - it
 * encapsulates the application's core data structures. It offers operations on
 * the encapsulated data, and regulates when and how these operations should be
 * performed. For example, the validity of certain operations may depend on,
 * and transform, the current state of the Model. The Model should be
 * independent of any particular
 * {@linkplain sep.mvc.AbstractController controller} or
 * {@linkplain sep.mvc.AbstractView view}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This base Model definition is empty. This definition is used to specify that
 * a Model is bound to a controller when the latter is created. In some
 * scenarios, a Model may maintain a reference to the View via which updates
 * can be actively pushed when the model is operated on - we opt not to specify
 * such functionality for our present application.
