 * A Controller is used to assemble the
 * {@linkplain sep.mvc.AbstractModel Model} and
 * {@linkplain sep.mvc.AbstractView view}(s), and is responsible for
 * coordinating operations between them to form the application as a whole. The
 * Controller is the central component that processes commands (from the
 * user-driven view) and other events of interest (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt;, network I/O) by
 * performing operations on the Model and view as appropriate.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Alternative application behaviours can be realised by different Controllers
 * over the same Model and views. Likewise, a Controller should be able to
 * handle any view that observes a compatible command protocol.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The binding of the Model and view to this Controller is fixed on creation.
