/**
 * A View provides the front-end user interface, which includes appropriate
 * presentation of the relevant model data to the user. The lifetime of an MVC
 * application is often tied to its front-end UI.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The View accepts user input, and conveys the corresponding commands to the
 * registered {@linkplain sep.mvc.AbstractController Controller} for
 * processing. The View interacts closely with the Controller, but should not
 * be coupled to any particular Controller (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, a View should be
 * interoperable with different Controllers).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A View may itself determine when it should be updated, and retrieve the
 * required information directly from the
 * {@linkplain sep.mvc.AbstractModel Model}, or operations performed on the
 * Model (as directed by the Controller) may actively push updates to the View,
 * or some combination thereof. The design can depend on whether the UI
 * supports synchronous or asynchronous user interactions.
